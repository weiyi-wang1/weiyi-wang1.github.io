I am a second-year PhD student at the University of Tasmania, working on safeguarding bird biodiversity in forest landscapes. My research investigates how birds respond to various forestry practices, aiming to find an ideal balance between timber production and conservation goals. 

As a nature lover and birdwatcher, my research journey has taken me from China to the UK, where I completed my Master’s degree and gained valuable field-based experience. Working as a research assistant in China after my Master’s allowed me to hone my skills in bird surveys across diverse ecosystems and build meaningful connections with fellow researchers. This PhD project feels like the perfect opportunity to combine my interests, background, and network into a cohesive exploration of forestry ecology, with the goal of improving conservation outcomes in managed forests.

About my research interests
======
My research combines field-based bird surveys, ecological modeling, and data analysis to drive better conservation outcomes and promote sustainable forest management. I am particularly focused on:

🌏 Human impacts on ecosystems – At a global scale, I investigate how human activities, particularly forestry and agriculture, affect biodiversity and ecosystem. 

🌳 Land use change and biodiversity – At a landscape scale, I explore the effects of land use changes on species diversity and the mechanisms driving species responses to habitat alteration. 

🦤 Biodiversity conservation in human-modified landscapes – I seek to develop strategies that enhance biodiversity conservation within managed and human-altered landscapes, striving to balance conservation goals with sustainable resource use.
